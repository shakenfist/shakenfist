# AGENTS.md - AI Agent Instructions for Shaken Fist

This file provides instructions for AI agents (Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, etc.)
working on the Shaken Fist codebase.

## Project Context

Shaken Fist is a minimal cloud orchestration platform for VM and network
management. See [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for detailed development guidance.

## CI/CD Architecture

### GitHub Actions Workflows

The repository uses several GitHub Actions workflows:

| Workflow | Purpose | Trigger |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `functional-tests.yml` | Main CI: lint, unit tests, functional tests | PR, merge_group |
| `documentation-tests.yml` | Build and test documentation | PR |
| `pin-indirect-dependencies.yml` | Keep indirect dependencies pinned | Daily schedule |
| `export-repo-config.yml` | Export GitHub repo settings to version control | Daily schedule |

### Merge Queue Pattern

The CI uses a two-stage merge queue pattern (see [this blog post](https://boinkor.net/2023/11/neat-github-actions-patterns-for-github-merge-queues/)):

1. **`Can enqueue`** - Runs on `pull_request` events, gates entry to merge queue
2. **`Can merge`** - Runs on `merge_group` events, gates the actual merge

**Important**: Only `Can see status` and `Can enqueue` are required status checks
in branch protection. `Can merge` is evaluated by the merge queue itself, not as
a required check.

### Exported Repository Configuration

Repository settings (rulesets, branch protection, merge queue config) are
exported to `.github/exported-config/` for version control and audit purposes:

- `repository-settings.json` - Repo-level settings
- `rulesets-summary.json` - List of all rulesets
- `ruleset-*.json` - Full details for each ruleset

If the `export-repo-config` workflow creates a PR, it means GitHub UI settings
have changed and should be reviewed.

## Automated CI Jobs

### Automated Delinter

When flake8 fails, the `automated_delinter` job runs Claude Code to fix lint
errors automatically. It skips if the last commit was from the bot to prevent
loops.

### Automated Exception Fixer

When functional tests detect exceptions in logs, the `automated_exception_fixer`
job downloads the test bundles and runs Claude Code to analyze and fix the
issues.

### Automated Reviewer

After successful tests, the `automated_reviewer` job runs Claude Code to review
the PR changes.

## Working with This Codebase

### Code Style

- Single quotes for strings, double quotes for docstrings
- 80 character line wrap
- Trim trailing whitespace
- See [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for detailed style guide

### Testing

```bash
tox                              # Run all tests
tox -eflake8                     # Lint check
tox -ecover                      # Coverage report
stestr run {test_name}           # Run specific test
```

### Pre-commit Hooks

The repository uses pre-commit hooks to validate code before commits:

```bash
pip install pre-commit           # Install pre-commit
pre-commit install               # Set up git hooks
pre-commit run --all-files       # Run all hooks manually
```

Current hooks:
- `actionlint` - Validates GitHub Actions workflow files

### Key Directories

- `shakenfist/` - Core package
- `shakenfist/daemons/` - Background services
- `shakenfist/external_api/` - REST API
- `.github/workflows/` - CI workflows
- `.github/exported-config/` - Exported GitHub settings
