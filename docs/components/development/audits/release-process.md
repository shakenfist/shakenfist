# Audit: Release process

## What we check

* There is no `release.sh` in the project directory.
* All Python projects use `pyproject.toml` (not `requirements.txt`
  or `test-requirements.txt`).
* If `pyproject.toml` exists, there must be a
  `.github/workflows/release.yml` and a `RELEASE-SETUP.md`.
* Releases use GitHub signed tags and Sigstore signing.
