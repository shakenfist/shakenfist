# Audit: Exporting repo configuration changes

## What we check

* `.github/workflows/export-repo-config.yml` exists.
* The workflow delegates to the shared reusable workflow in
  `shakenfist/actions` and runs daily at 00:30 UTC.
* The workflow is project-agnostic and can be copied directly with
  no modifications.

## Template

Template: `templates/export-repo-config/`
See: `templates/export-repo-config/README.md`

## Projects

<!-- consistency-audit:begin -->
*This table is regenerated daily by the consistency audit
workflow from `scripts/audit-check.py` results; do not edit
it by hand.*
